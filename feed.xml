<p>Cancelled fieldwork and travel, classes gone fully remote, and concerns about family, friends, and ourselves pose many twists and changes to our current reality.</p>

<p>Fortunately members of the WAVES lab find time to connect through virtual lab meetings. Our lab meetings have at times struggled to find a coherent thread given folks’ (often) disparate research topics.  Now in a time of working from home and physical distancing, our lab meeting’s purpose has become more clear: Checking in and supporting each other.</p>

<p>We might not be able to do face-to-face meetings, happy hours or game nights for a while longer, but we still have our solid support group.</p>

After experiencing <a href="http://blog.chg.ucsb.edu/?p=266">back-to-back</a> droughts in 2016 and 2017, you are unsure about what to expect for the upcoming 2018 growing season. Will the rains come back this year? Will there be yet another drought? These questions affect important decisions that farmers make before and during the growing season such as whether to plant drought-resistent crops or whether to purchase early maturing seed varieties.</p>

<p>The 2018 rainy season in central Kenya has been anything but ordinary. While many farmers relished the above-average volumes of rainfall which they hope will lead to a productive growing season, other farmers suffered from the deluges that led to flooded fields and washed away crops.</p>

<p>The WAVES team, led by PhD student <a href="/people/krell/">Natasha Krell</a>, sought out to understand these questions surrounding agricultural decision-making using advances in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/mmg_disp.jsp?med_id=82037&amp;from=">real-time crop monitoring weather stations</a> and social science surveys. Together with our instrumental Kenya-based team members, <a href="/people/gitonga/">John Gitonga</a> and <a href="/people/mukoma/">Boniface Mukoma</a>, the WAVES lab deployed ca. 60 field-based Arable Mark crop-monitoring weather stations as well as led social science surveys of over 600 farmers.</p>

<p>Research collaborations between the WAVES lab at U.C. Santa Barbara, the University of Arizona, the California Polytechnic State University, and the Mpala Research Center in Laikipia, Kenya
culminated in a household survey on agricultural management, water resource governance, use of weather and climate forecasts, coping and adaptation to climate as well as other topics. The researchers gathered longitudinal data on over 600 heads of households or spouses in Laikipia, Meru and Nyeri counties.</p>

<p>As the NSF-WSC grant comes to an end in 2019, our research highlights advances in environmental data collection through a field-based sensor network along with farmer surveys to better understand how smallholders respond to climate variability. Our findings can provide insight on agricultural shocks such as crop failure or pest and disease occurence, and to what extent these shocks can be predicted and mitigated.</p>]]></content><author><name>Natasha Krell</name><email>nkrell@ucsb.edu</email></author><category term="News" /><category term="Research" /><category term="Collaboration" /><category term="Smallholder Agriculture" /><category term="Kenya" /><category term="Fieldwork" /><category term="Water Sustainability Climate" /><category term="Mpala Research Center" /><category term="Natasha Krell" /><category term="2018" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[NSF WSC grant culminates in deployment of ca. 60 Arable Marks and social surveys involving several universities in Kenya's Mount Kenya region]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ryan Avery developing ML system for Omidyar Network at Clark Labs</title><link href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/2018/06/29/summer-omidyar-project/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ryan Avery developing ML system for Omidyar Network at Clark Labs" /><published>2018-06-28T17:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-06-28T17:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/2018/06/29/avery-summer-omidyar</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/2018/06/29/summer-omidyar-project/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/people/avery/">Ryan Avery</a> will be at Clark Labs developing software for the project “Developing and Scaling Up The Mapping Africa Active Learning Platform”, funded by the <a href="https://www.omidyar.com/insights/reimagining-agricultural-insurance-protect-smallholder-farmers-worldwide" target="_blank">Omidyar Network</a>. He will be working with the team to build a scalable system for detecting smallholder farm fields across Africa, focusing first on a sub-region of Ghana. Crowdsourced maps of smallholder fields have been shown to be an effective data source to train models to predict the locations of unmapped fields. Ryan work this summer will be to implement neural network and random forest models on Amazon Web Service’s cloud computing infrastructure to locate fields with near human-level ability at flexible spatial scale. Ultimately the deliverable sof this project will be a rich dataset of smallholder agriculture locations across Africa, opening new possibilities for targeted research on changing land use patterns and land cover in dynamic agricultural regions. The methods work is a continuation of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.03.010">Debats et al. 2016</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.03.010">Debats et al. 2017</a>.

<h2 id="riparian-ecohydrological-dynamics">Riparian Ecohydrological Dynamics</h2>

<p>The first position is in the area of riparian ecohydrological dynamics. The WAVES lab (<a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu">caylor.eri.ucsb.edu</a>) is participating in two multi-institutional projects that seek to develop novel insight into the the sustainability and resilience of riparian forest ecosystems and tools for quantitative support of land/water conservation management plans in arid and semi-arid landscapes across the southwestern US and southern France. Our project goals are to detect and assess the responses of sensitive riparian forests to drought stress over recent decades, and to generalize these responses through modeling of a warming/drying climate punctuated by variable rainfall.</p>

<p>A successful candidate’s duties would include, under supervision and within a multi-institution team environment: (1) developing and implementing landscape-scale models of riparian ecohydrology that incorporate stochastic dynamics of rainfall, surface/subsurface dynamics, plant water use and vegetation stress; (2) integrating and verifying model dynamics against multi-year meteorological data and isotopic records of riparian vegetation water sources; (3) leveraging high-resolution imagery of vegetation function and structure derived from unmanned autonomous vehicles for improved characterization of riparian ecohydrological dynamics.</p>

<p>Additional detail regarding this research effort can be found <a href="http://caylor.eri.ucsb.edu/2018/01/28/riparian-ecohydrology-awards/">here</a>. Interested individuals can appy <a href="https://recruit.ap.ucsb.edu/apply/JPF01253">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="coupled-natural-human-system-modeling">Coupled Natural-Human System Modeling</h2>

<p>The second position is in the area of coupled natural-human system modeling. The WAVES lab (caylor.eri.ucsb.edu) is conducting research that seeks to reveal the dynamics of production and consumption of food, energy, and water resources in sub-Saharan Africa, and use these revelations to develop solutions that can better sustain coupled food, energy, and water systems through improved multi-scale, multi-resource governance.</p>

<p>A successful candidate’s duties would include, under supervision and within a multi-institution team environment: (1) developing and implementing models of coupled natural-human systems within smallholder agricultural settings; (2) integrating and verifying model dynamics against novel data sets of high-frequency, co-located in-situ observations of agricultural decision making and crop/climate dynamics; (3) leading the authorship of research manuscripts for publication based on model development and applications.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ifpri.org/profile/kwaw-andam">Dr. Kwaw Andam</a>, a research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institutes’s (IFPRI) Ghana Strategy Support Program recently visited the WAVES lab and the Department of Geography at UCSB for a week of collaboration. Previously an economist for the World Bank, Dr. Andam’s research focuses on agro-processing, value chain analysis, and livestock production in Ghana. He and <a href="/people/tuholske/">Cascade Tuholske</a> conducted an urban food security survey in Accra in summer 2017 to assess the demographic, socioeconomic, and spatial predictors of household food security in low- and middle-income neighborhoods in Accra, Ghana’s capital. This research is supported by a <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/food/programs/borlaug-fellows/graduate-research-grants.php">Borlaug Fellowship in Global Food Security</a> and IFPRI. While at UCSB, Dr. Andam assisted Cascade with data analysis and drafting of a paper that they plan to publish this spring. While much of his time was spent in the office, Dr. Andam still had time to visit local favorites such as Cold Springs Tavern and the Santa Barbara Harbor.</p>]]></content><author><name>Cascade Tuholske</name><email>cascade@umail.ucsb.edu</email><uri>https://www.tuholske.com</uri></author><category term="News" /><category term="Research" /><category term="2018" /><category term="IFPRI" /><category term="Cascade Tuholske" /><category term="Food Security" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dr. Kwaw Andam, a research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institutes's Ghana Strategy Support Program in Accra visited our lab at UCSB to collaborate on an urban food security research project.]]></summary></entry></feed>
